# Competitive Programming Repository

Welcome to my competitive programming repository. This collection primarily features problems from [Strivers CP Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interview-experience/strivers-cp-sheet/) on Codeforces.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific problem from the Strivers CP Sheet on Codeforces. Inside each folder, you will find:

- My solution to the problem.
- The optimal solution.
- Analysis of the time and space complexities of both solutions.

## Goals of This Repository

1. **Learning Through Comparison**: By juxtaposing my solutions with the optimal ones, I aim to discern patterns, best practices, and areas for improvement in my coding and problem-solving strategies.
2. **Resource for Others**: This repository can serve as a resource for other competitive programmers. By examining the comparison between different solution strategies, one can gain a deeper understanding of problem-solving techniques in competitive programming.
3. **Documentation**: To maintain a record of my progression and challenges faced in competitive programming, enabling me to revisit and refine my skills.

## How to Use

1. **Browse Problems**: Navigate to the specific problem folder you're interested in.
2. **Compare Solutions**: Inside, you'll find both my solution and the optimal solution, allowing for a side-by-side comparison.
3. **Analyze Complexities**: For each solution, there's an accompanying analysis of its time and space complexities to help understand the efficiency and trade-offs of different approaches.

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as my personal documentation, contributions and feedback are always welcome. If you find any mistakes, or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or a pull request.
